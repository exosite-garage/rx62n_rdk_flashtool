/* Define a struct that holds our meta information for interacting with the
  cloud.  For the Renesas toolchain, this information should already be in 
  flash.  If it is not in flash, flash will have to be initialized by the user 
  app or other software environment (e.g. uC/OSIII) that has routines written 
  for the "registration" api.
  The idea here is that the system has been pre-registered/configured, 
  and during the registration process (usually this is during functional
  test in manufacturing), this information was programmed.   Thereafter,
  the information can be read from flash during normal operation.  If the 
  system software is capable, it can continue to periodically read the 
  values from the cloud to monitor for required system changes.  If it
  finds the values are different (newer) than the values in flash, it
  may indicate that a system update is required(e.g. firmware).  After taking
  the necessary action, the system would typically re-program the meta 
  information in flash to sync with the cloud version.
  Note that the only information really required to be hard-coded is the
  server ip address, server port number, api structure, alias name for
  meta data, product type ID and unique identifier (MAC address).
  Note: structure is stored in data flash block 14.  Must not exceed block 14
  flash size of 2kBytes.  Also, all elements must be padded to 8 bytes per 
  element due to write limitation.
